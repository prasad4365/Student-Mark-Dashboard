# Student-Mark-Dashboard
Students subject marks management system 


## Features of our Student Mark Board Application Project


• It is a simple one interface java application.

• Firstly, we must give Index number and Marks into the application as a data.

• And then we can use this application to calculate some important parameters of one subject’s
mark collection of students.

• We can calculate, Student count, Maximum mark, Minimum mark, Average mark and also each student’s Grade
(A,B like this ).

• We have another feature we can get final summary report as well.


## Special things in our application



• We did not limited number of students. You can add any number of student’s details.

• Consider input part, (Index Filed, mark field and add button) .

• Since if you do not input index or mark or may be both and then click add button, that time you
can see Dialog box message will be given by application automatically.” Please fill all details”

• Another thing is the marks should be a numerical value. But we can input characters and
numerical values as well in jTextField. This situation we must consider numerical value for the
mark. Therefore, we converted jTextField to consider numerical values only. If you are going
type characters in mark field, you can’t do that, and you can hear Error sound when you do it.

• And also, if we consider other operations as well, Since you do not input any details and If you try to get results and going to save summary as well
operations can’t do that." You haven’t entered students details yet!" like a Dialog box message
will be given by app.

• When you try to clear students details “Do you want to clear all students details ?” like a Dialog
box confirmation message will be given by app with have yes ,no options.

• Application have included tool tips for the buttons, colored button and user familiar interface.
